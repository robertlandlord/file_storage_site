# Creative Portion

For our creative portion, we created the functionality to both create new users and delete existing users. 
From the initial login page, those without current accounts can create a user.


By pressing "Create", you can:
  - Add your username to the "users.txt" file
  - Create a folder with your username for file storage (in srv/uploads)

By pressing "delet this", you can
  - Delete your username from the "users.txt" file
  - Delete your folder (and all files in that folder)

### Login Details

Currently, there are a few pre-made accounts:
* Brock
* robertlmao
* grahamrubin

Feel free to create your own user using the Create button! :)
